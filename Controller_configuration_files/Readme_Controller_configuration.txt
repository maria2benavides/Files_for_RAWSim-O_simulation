This are all the .xconf that we use for the simulation of hyper-heuristics.

example: iniF_0.1N_0.9SB_
iniF o iniFIXED: mean that we use the heuristic "fixed" to initialize.
iniR o iniRAND: mean that we use the heuristic "random" to initialize.
number+word : the number means the percentage of simulation time and the word is the initial of the name of the heuristic.
                  R - Random
                  F - Fixed
                  N - Nearest
                  S - Station based
                  C - Cache
                  T - Turnover
