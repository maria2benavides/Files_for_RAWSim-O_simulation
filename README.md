# üìù Files for the RAWSim-O simulation framework
This repository was created to share the files necessary to simulate our work with the RAWSim-O framework. Note that not all files are used in all manuscripts. So, we strive to provide this information within the current file. 

We have published the following works that tackle the pod allocation problem:

1. M. T. Benavides-Robles, J. M. Cruz-Duarte, J. C. Ortiz-Bayliss, and I. Amaya, ‚Äò‚ÄòOn the feasibility of using a high-level solver within robotic mobile fulfillment systems.‚Äô‚Äô IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, 2023, pp. 1274‚Äì1279. DOI: 10.1109/SSCI52147.2023.10371931 
2. M. T. Benavides-Robles, J. M. Cruz-Duarte, I. Amaya, and J. C. Ortiz-Bayliss, ‚Äò‚ÄòOn the feasibility of using neural networks as high-level solvers for the pod allocation problem within robotic mobile fulfillment systems,‚Äô‚Äô in 2023 10th International Conference on Soft Computing & Machine Intelligence (ISCMI), 2023, pp. 91‚Äì95. DOI: 10.1109/ISCMI59957.2023.10458645
